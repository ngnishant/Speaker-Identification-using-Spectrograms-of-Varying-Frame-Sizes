<p>This chapter discusses some general principles of biometric recognition 
 systems, describes different classification errors and explains how the 
 quality of two systems can be compared objectively.</p>

<h3>Identification vs. Verification</h3>

<p>A biometric recognition system can run in two different modes: identification 
 or verification. Identification is the process of trying to find out a 
 person's identity by examining a biometric pattern calculated from the 
 person's biometric features.</p>

<p>In the identification case, the system is trained with the patterns 
 of several persons. For each of the persons, a biometric template is calculated 
 in this training stage. A pattern that is going to be identified is matched 
 against every known template, yielding either a score or a distance describing 
 the similarity between the pattern and the template. The system assigns 
 the pattern to the person with the most similar biometric template. To 
 prevent impostor patterns (in this case all patterns of persons not known 
 by the system) from being correctly identified, the similarity has to 
 exceed a certain level. If this level is not reached, the pattern is rejected.</p>

<p>In the verification case, a person's identity is claimed a priori. The 
 pattern that is verified only is compared with the person's individual 
 template. Similar to identification, it is checked whether the similarity 
 between pattern and template is sufficient to provide access to the secured 
 system or area.</p>

<h3>Thresholding (False Acceptance / False Rejection)</h3>

<p>BioID uses scores (also called weights) to express the similarity between 
 a pattern and a biometric template. The higher the score is, the higher 
 is the similarity between them. As described in the preceding section, 
 access to the system is granted only, if the score for a trained person 
 (identification) or the person that the pattern is verified against (verification) 
 is higher than a certain threshold.</p>

<p>In theory, client scores (scores of patterns from persons known by the 
 system) should always be higher than the scores of impostors. If this 
 would be true, a single threshold, that separates the two groups of scores, 
 could be used to differ between clients and impostors.</p>

<p>Due to several reasons, this assumption isn't true for real world biometric 
 systems. In some cases impostor patterns generate scores that are higher 
 than the scores of some client patterns. For that reason it is a fact, 
 that however the classification threshold is chosen, some classification 
 errors occur.</p>

<p>For example you can choose the threshold such high, that really no impostor 
 scores will exceed this limit. As a result, no patterns are falsely accepted 
 by the system. On the other hand the client patterns with scores lower 
 than the highest impostor scores are falsely rejected. In opposition to 
 this, you can choose the threshold such low, that no client patterns are 
 falsely rejected. Then, on the other hand, some impostor patterns are 
 falsely accepted. If you choose the threshold somewhere between those 
 two points, both false rejections and false acceptances occur.</p>

<p>The following figures should help to achieve a better understanding 
 of this topic. Think of a biometric verification system, which is tested 
 with a large amount of test data. The test data consists of both impostor 
 and client patterns. Let's first take a look at the impostor patterns. 
 The belonging scores would be somehow distributed around a certain mean 
 score. This is depicted in the first image on the left side. A gaussian 
 normal distribution is chosen in this example.</p>

<p>Depending on the choice of the classification threshold, between all 
 and none of the impostor patterns are falsely accepted by the system. 
 The threshold depending fraction of the falsely accepted patterns divided 
 by the number of all impostor patterns is called <b>False Acceptance Rate 
 (FAR)</b>. Its value is one, if all impostor patterns are falsely accepted 
 and zero, if none of the impostor patterns is accepted. Look on the graphic 
 on the right to see the values of the FAR for the score distribution of 
 the left image for varying threshold.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">
<img src="About_EER_files/EER_imp.gif" style="width: 643px; height: 169px;" border="0" height="169" width="643"></p>

<p>Now let's change to the client patterns. Similar to the impostor scores, 
 the client pattern's scores vary around a certain mean value. The 
 mean score of the client patterns is higher than the mean value of the 
 impostor patterns, as shown in the left of the following two images. If 
 a classification threshold that is too high is applied to the classification 
 scores, some of the client patterns are falsely rejected. Depending on 
 the value of the threshold, between none and all of the client patterns 
 will be falsely rejected. The fraction of the number of rejected client 
 patterns divided by the total number of client patterns is called <b>False 
 Rejection Rate (FRR)</b>. According to the FAR, its value lies in between 
 zero and one. The image on the right shows the FAR for a varying threshold 
 for the score distribution shown in the image on the left.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">
<img src="About_EER_files/EER_client.gif" style="width: 666px; height: 198px;" border="0" height="198" width="666"></p>

<p>The choice of the threshold value becomes a problem if the distributions 
 of the client and the impostor scores overlap, as shown in the next image 
 on the left. On the right, the corresponding false acceptance and false 
 rejection rates are displayed.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">
<img src="About_EER_files/EER_all.gif" style="width: 666px; height: 198px;" border="0" height="198" width="666"> </p>

<p>Note that if the score distributions overlap, the FAR and FRR intersect 
 at a certain point. The value of the FAR and the FRR at this point, which 
 is of course the same for both of them, is called the <b>Equal Error Rate 
 (EER)</b>.</p>

<h3>Comparing biometric systems</h3>

<p>Imagine the comparison of two biometric systems. The manufacturers of 
 the systems just specify a single value for the FARs of them. Is this 
 sufficient to compare both systems? The answer clearly is no, if the manufacturers 
 do not provide the corresponding FRRs. In this case, it is possible that 
 the system with the lower FAR has got an unacceptable high FRR.</p>

<p>But also when the values for FAR and FRR are given, there still exists 
 the problem, that those values are threshold depending. Assuming that 
 the threshold of the systems is adjustable, there is no reasonable way 
 to decide if a system with a higher FAR and a lower FRR performs better 
 than a system with a lower FAR and a higher FRR value.</p>

<p>The EER of a system can be used to give a threshold independent performance 
 measure. The lower the EER is, the better is the system's performance, 
 as the total error rate which is the sum of the FAR and the FRR at the 
 point of the EER decreases. In theory this works fine, if the EER of the 
 system is calculated using an infinite and representative test set, which 
 of course is not possible under real world conditions. To get comparable 
 results it is therefore necessary that the EERs that are compared are 
 calculated on the same test data using the same test protocol.</p>

<p>Some effort is done to achieve large and publicly available test sets 
 and protocols like the FERET and the XM2VTS databases for face recognition 
 evaluation. But even if there exist some of those test sets for single 
 biometric modalities, it still is very hard to compare systems relying 
 on different ones (e.g. face and fingerprint).</p>
